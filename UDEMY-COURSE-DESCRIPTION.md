## Course Description

### 🚀 What You'll Learn

Have you ever wondered how companies like Amazon, Netflix, or Uber process millions of orders and events in real-time? In this comprehensive, hands-on course, you'll build a complete enterprise-grade real-time application from scratch - just like the systems used by top tech companies!

**By the end of this course, you will:**

✅ Build a real-time order processing pipeline with Apache Kafka  
✅ Create Python microservices that consume Kafka messages  
✅ Store and query data using Couchbase NoSQL database  
✅ Build a REST API with FastAPI  
✅ Create a live dashboard with React  
✅ Containerize everything with Docker  
✅ Deploy to AWS ECS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
✅ Monitor and troubleshoot production applications  

### 🎯 What We're Building

You'll build a complete **real-time order processing system** that:

- **Producer Service**: Generates orders and sends them to Kafka every 2 seconds
- **Fraud Detection Service**: Analyzes orders in real-time to detect suspicious transactions
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments asynchronously
- **Analytics Service**: Stores orders in Couchbase and calculates running totals
- **Backend API**: Serves data via FastAPI REST endpoints
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Displays live order analytics in a React dashboard
- **AWS Deployment**: Everything running on AWS ECS with auto-scaling and load balancing

**Live Demo:** See the system in action at [orders.jumptotech.net](https://orders.jumptotech.net)

### 📚 Course Structure

This course is designed for **complete beginners**. No prior experience with Kafka, AWS, or Terraform is required! We'll start from the basics and build up to a production-ready system.

6. **FastAPI Backend** - Build REST API with automatic documentation
7. **React Frontend** - Create a live dashboard with auto-refresh
8. **Docker Containerization** - Package everything in containers
9. **AWS Infrastructure** - Understand cloud computing and AWS services
10. **Terraform Basics** - Learn Infrastructure as Code
11. **AWS ECS Deployment** - Deploy your application to production
12. **Monitoring & Troubleshooting** - Keep your system healthy
13. **Advanced Topics** - Scaling, updates, and optimization
14. **Course Wrap-up** - Recap and next steps

### 🎓 Who This Course Is For

**Perfect for:**
- Python developers who want to learn real-time systems
- Backend developers looking to add Kafka to their skillset
- DevOps engineers learning Infrastructure as Code
- Students and professionals building portfolio projects
- Anyone curious about how modern distributed systems work

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command line (terminal)
- No prior Kafka, AWS, or Terraform experience needed!

### 💡 Why This Course?

**Real-World Project:**
This isn't a toy example - you'll build a system that could actually be used in production. The architecture, technologies, and deployment strategies are all industry-standard.

**Complete End-to-End:**
Most courses teach one technology. This course shows you how to combine multiple technologies into a working system - from code to cloud deployment.

**Hands-On Learning:**
Every concept is demonstrated with real code. You'll type along, make mistakes (and fix them!), and see everything working.

**Beginner-Friendly:**
We explain every concept from scratch. No assumptions about prior knowledge. If you know Python basics, you can follow along.

**Production-Ready:**
Learn best practices: environment variables, secrets management, health checks, monitoring, error handling, and more.

### 🛠️ Technologies You'll Master

- **Apache Kafka** - Real-time streaming platform
- **Confluent Cloud** - Managed Kafka service
- **Python** - Backend microservices
- **Couchbase** - NoSQL document database
- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **React** - Frontend JavaScript framework
- **Docker** - Containerization
